# GEMINI.md: Digital Economy Exam Response Framework (Concise Edition)

## 1. Exam Response Strategy (应试答题策略)
To ensure high scores and memorability, responses must adhere to the **"Compact Four-Step Logic" (定性-构成-机制-导向)**. This structure ensures all key scoring points are hit within a concise word limit (~400 words).

## 2. The 4-Step Template (4步速记模版)

### Step 1: Definition & Status (定性与地位)
*   **Role**: Define the concept and its strategic status in one sentence.
*   **Keywords**: "Fundamental basis", "Core engine", "Structural transformation", "Four beams and eight columns".
*   **Action**: Directly define the subject using `full.md` terminology.

### Step 2: Core Components/Characteristics (内涵与构成)
*   **Role**: List the specific classifications or key features.
*   **Keywords**: "Encompasses...", "Characterized by...", "Divided into...".
*   **Action**: Enumerate key elements (e.g., "Industry Substitution, Skill Mismatch"). **Must cover all sub-points from text.**

### Step 3: Operational Mechanism (运行机制)
*   **Role**: Explain the theoretical logic or economic principle.
*   **Keywords**: "Via mechanism of...", "Substitution vs. Complementarity", "Cost reduction", "Efficiency enhancement".
*   **Action**: Use economic theory to explain *how* it works (e.g., Task-Biased Technological Change).

### Step 4: Policy/Strategic Implication (影响与导向)
*   **Role**: Conclude with the macro impact or required policy response.
*   **Keywords**: "Inequality risk", "High-quality development", "Policy imperative".
*   **Action**: Link to national goals (Common Prosperity, Security) or negative consequences needing mitigation.

## 3. Strict Execution Rules (执行规范)
1.  **Word Count**: Target **150-200 words**. Be ruthless with adjectives.
2.  **No Metaphors**: Use professional terminology only (e.g., use "Factor input" not "Fuel").
3.  **Citation**: Mark the source chapter/file for key points `[Source: ChX/LineY]`.
4.  **Completeness**: Check against `full.md` to ensure no "causes" or "effects" are missed.

## 4. Demo: Application to "Impact on Employment Structure"

**Q: Elaborate on the impact of digital technology on employment structure.**

**A:**
1.  **[定性]**: The impact is a process of **"creative destruction"** and **structural transformation** driven by technological progress [13/L103].
2.  **[构成]**: It manifests as **"employment polarization"** (U-shaped): demand increases for high-skill cognitive and low-skill service jobs, while middle-skill routine jobs are hollowed out. Structural unemployment arises from **industry substitution, skill mismatch, automation**, and the **digital divide** [13/L59, L245].
3.  **[机制]**: The mechanism follows **Task-Biased Technological Change**. Digital technology exerts a **substitution effect** on routine tasks (capital replacing labor) while providing a **complementary effect** for creative tasks, alongside a **creation effect** from new business models [13/L39, L81].
4.  **[导向]**: This shift risks exacerbating **income inequality**. Policy must focus on **education reform** (upskilling), **labor rights protection** (for new forms), and optimizing **income redistribution** to ensure common prosperity [13/L167, L249].
